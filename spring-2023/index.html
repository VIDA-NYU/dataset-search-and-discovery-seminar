In this talk, we present our recent work that explores a new class of dataset search queries that uncovers data relationships in large table collections. In particular, we focus on join-correlation queries: given an input query table, find the top-k tables that are both joinable with it and contain columns strongly correlated with a column in the query table. Unfortunately, a naïve approach to evaluate these queries, which first finds joinable tables and then explicitly materializes joins and computes correlations between the query and all discovered tables, is prohibitively expensive. To solve this problem, we 1) present novel data sketching methods that enable the construction of an index for a large number of tables and that provide accurate estimates for join-correlation queries, and 2) explore different indexing and scoring strategies that effectively retrieve and rank the query results based on how well the columns are correlated with the query.\nBio Aécio Santos is a Research Engineer in the Visualization, Imaging, and Data Analysis (VIDA) group at New York University (NYU). He received a Master’s Degree in Computer Science from the Federal University of Minas Gerais (in Brazil) and is currently a part-time Ph.D. candidate at New York University under the supervision of Prof. Juliana Freire. Over the years, he has worked, both in academia and industry, on a wide range of problems related to web crawling, news recommendation and classification, automated machine learning, and dataset search. He has served as a reviewer and has published papers at multiple premier data management and information retrieval conferences and journals such as VLDB, SIGMOD, WWW, WSDM, SIGIR, and CIKM.\nTalk by Natasha Noy Abstract There are thousands of data repositories on the Web, providing access to tens of millions of datasets. National and regional governments, scientific publishers and consortia, commercial data providers, and others publish data for fields ranging from social science to life science to high-energy physics to climate science and more. Access to this data is critical to facilitating reproducibility of research results, enabling scientists to build on others’ work, and providing data journalists easier access to information and its provenance. The talk will discuss Dataset Search by Google, which provides search capabilities over potentially all dataset repositories on the Web. I will talk about the open ecosystem for describing datasets that we hope to encourage. I will discuss what we have learned by analyzing the corpus of more than 45 million dataset descriptions. Finally, I will discuss research challenges in building a vibrant, heterogeneous, and open ecosystem where data becomes a first-class citizen.\nBio Natasha Noy is a scientist at Google Research where she works on making structured data accessible and useful. She leads the team building Dataset Search, a search engine for all the datasets on the Web. Prior to joining Google, she worked at Stanford Center for Biomedical Informatics Research where she made major contributions in the areas of ontology development and alignment, and collaborative ontology engineering. Dr. Noy is a Fellow of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI). She has served as the President of the Semantic Web Science Association from 2011 to 2017.\nTalk by Raul Castro Fernandez Abstract TBD.\nBio TBD.\nTalk by Fatemeh Nargesian Abstract TBD.\nBio TBD.\n","wordCount":"669","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://vida-nyu.github.io/dataset-search-and-discovery-seminar/spring-2023/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"VIDA Dataset Search and Discovery Seminar Series","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://vida-nyu.github.io/dataset-search-and-discovery-seminar/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://vida-nyu.github.io/dataset-search-and-discovery-seminar/ accesskey=h title="VIDA Dataset Search and Discovery Seminar Series (Alt + H)">VIDA Dataset Search and Discovery Seminar Series</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class=post-title>Spring 2023</h1><div class=post-meta></div></header><div class=post-content><h1 id=about>About<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#about>#</a></h1><p>The VIDA Dataset Search and Discovery seminar covers recent research in the dataset discovery area.
